Challenges

    Check out a new branch in your data-structures-and-algorithms repository.
    Make a new directory in the code-challenges directory of your repo named value-vs-reference.
    Create a file in this new directory named challenges-02.test.js.
    Copy and paste the entire content of today’s code challenge into the new file.
    Run npm test to execute the tests in the folder for today’s challenge.
    Write code to make the tests pass, one at a time. Let the error messages guide you.
    Once the test is passing, refactor as needed, then move on to the next challenge.

Submission

When you have completed the entire set of code challenges and all tests pass, create a pull request from your current branch to the master branch and merge it into master.
