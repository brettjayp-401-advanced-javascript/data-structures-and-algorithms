## array binary search

# Challenge Summary

.



## Challenge Description

### Primary:

Write a function called `BinarySearch` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

### Stretch:

Once you’ve achieved a working solution, benchmark with varying array sizes (100, 10000, 100000 elements)
