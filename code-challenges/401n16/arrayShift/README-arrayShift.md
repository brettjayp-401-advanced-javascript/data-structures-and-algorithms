## array shift

# Challenge Summary

Create and test a function to add a value in the middle of an array. Stretch goal included.



## Challenge Description

### Primary:

Write a function called `insertShiftArray` which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

### Stretch:

Once youâ€™ve achieved a working solution, write a second function that removes an element from the middle index and shifts other elements in the array to fill the new gap.
