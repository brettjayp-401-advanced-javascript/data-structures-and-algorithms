Challenges

    Check out a new branch in your data-structures-and-algorithms repository.
    Navigate into the for-each directory that you created in the setup assignment.
    Create a file in this new directory named challenges-01.test.js.
    Copy and paste the entire content of today’s code challenge into the new file.
    In your terminal, change to the folder for today’s code challenge and run npm test to execute the tests in the file. At this point you will see the failed tests scroll through your terminal window with a brief report of the number of failed tests at the bottom. If you do not see this, verify your installation of Jest by typing npx jest --version in your terminal. Filename typos can make things break!
    Write code to make the tests pass, one at a time. Let the error messages guide you.
    Once the test is passing, refactor as needed, then move on to the next challenge.

Submission

When you have completed the entire set of code challenges and all tests pass, create a pull request from your current branch to the master branch and merge it into master.
