    Copy and paste the entire content of today’s code challenge into the new file.
    Run npm test to execute the tests in the folder for today’s challenge.
    Write code to make the tests pass, one at a time. Let the error messages guide you.
    Once the test is passing, refactor as needed, then move on to the next challenge.
